### Heroic 4

##### What's Changed
Heroic has traditionally been built on Vue and Node with regular javascript/babel.  This iteration, things are being shifted.
We are moving to a full Typescript platform with Nest at the forefront of our backend and React on the frontend.
Everything will be fully tested and coverage is aimed at 95% by initial release.

##### Developers First
Heroic will be built with long term support planned.  NestJS is being used so that other developers may use the Heroic module
and build on top of it.  This will make receiving updates much easier than going through an annoying merge request process.

##### Supported Projects
These projects are endorsed by Heroic, but not related to Heroic.  I nor the developers of Heroic have done work on these
projects.
