      <p>Our hotel is still undergoing development and as a result, some things may not work.  Don't be alarmed!  This is expected as we make changes to the hotel and work on behalf of you, the user.</p>
      <p>We actively encourage all users to participate in reporting any issues they may come across.  You may do so by going onto the Discord which can be accessed by viewing the social media page.</p>
      <p>You are also more than free to request new features you would like to see or any ideas for the future!</p>
