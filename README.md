## Welcome to version 4
Heroic 4 is a breathe of fresh air, as we dive into a platform built around stability instead of features. 
This version of Heroic, has been rebuilt from the ground up using next generation libraries such as *Nest* and *Apollo*.

Our philosphy this time around is to branch features out in a fashionable order, while implementing unit tests every step of the way.
After all, what fun is a web server if it breaks?

## What does this mean?
As an end user, it means you will be enjoying a better experience.  One without errors, random bugs or side effects.

As a developer, it means you can actually contribute to the source without trembling in fear at the thought of breaking something else.
