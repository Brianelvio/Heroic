# Heroic 3.1 
This is the source code for the new 3.1 rewrite of the back-end.
Unfortunately, it is a necessary evil to rewrite the source code
so that I may be able to extend features without a hassle.

The new folder structure is based around Laravel and 
also a modular approach.  A lot of steps have also 
been taken to write the code in a Laravel way as to
provide a more beautiful and cleaner code.
